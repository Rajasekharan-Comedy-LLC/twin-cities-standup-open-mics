Will not ask questions about how you identify, (other than your pronouns for the sake of announcing you on stage referring to you when your name doesn't work for something) but you're pretty much admitting you are one of those identities by doing the mic. Six slots with five minutes each. The open mic portion runs from 8 to 8:30pm. After that there's a showcase with music and comedy (featuring 2-3 pre-booked comedians) which starts at 8:30pm. Sign up in person at 7:30pm or in advance through email at:<a href=\"mailto:vector9varietyshow@gmail.com\">vector9varietyshow@gmail.com</a> (this email is used for sign ups for more than one mic so please specify which one you're referring to in the email header.)"
